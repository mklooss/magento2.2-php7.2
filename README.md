```
{
    "extra": {
        "enable-patching": true,
        "composer-exit-on-patch-failure": false,
        "patches-file": "composer.php72.json"
    }
}
```

you should also add the deployed "composer.php72.json" to your git Project Repository.

To Avoid Issues with wrong PHP Version and missing MCrypt you can add this also to your composer.json

```
{
    "config": {
        "platform": {
            "php": "7.1.0",
